-- Create audio call session
INSERT INTO calls (
    title, channel_name, creator_id, is_public, max_participants, 
    call_type, status, created_at
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 'audio', 'active', NOW());

-- Track participant with voice masking
INSERT INTO call_participants (
    call_id, user_id, agora_uid, joined_at, masking_enabled
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, NOW(), TRUE);

-- Log voice masking usage
INSERT INTO masking_activities (
    user_id, activity_type, session_id, created_at
) VALUES (?, 'voice_masking', ?, NOW());
```

## 14. üìπ Conducting Video Chat

### Step-by-Step Actions:
1. Pre-member+ user initiates video chat session
2. System requests camera and microphone permissions
3. User's face masking and voice modification activate
4. System applies real-time video processing with avatar overlay
5. Other participants join with their identity masking
6. Video conversation proceeds with full privacy protection
7. System monitors video quality and bandwidth
8. Users can toggle video/audio while maintaining masking
9. Screen sharing available with content filtering
10. Session ends with comprehensive activity logging

### Prerequisites & Authorization:
- Must have `pre-member` or `full-member` status
- Must have active Converse Identity
- Camera and microphone permissions required
- Sufficient bandwidth for video streaming

### System Feedback:
- Camera setup and masking preview
- Video quality and connection indicators
- Participant video status updates
- Masking effectiveness notifications

### User Status/Privilege Changes:
- **Before**: Same membership status
- **After**: Enhanced video communication activity
- Advanced Converse Identity usage metrics
- Access to video call analytics

### Database Changes:
```sql
-- Create video call session
INSERT INTO calls (
    title, channel_name, creator_id, is_public, max_participants,
    call_type, status, created_at
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 'video', 'active', NOW());

-- Track participant with full masking
INSERT INTO call_participants (
    call_id, user_id, agora_uid, joined_at, 
    voice_masking_enabled, video_masking_enabled
) VALUES (?, ?, ?, NOW(), TRUE, TRUE);

-- Log comprehensive masking usage
INSERT INTO masking_activities (
    user_id, activity_type, session_id, masking_features, created_at
) VALUES (?, 'full_masking', ?, 'voice,video,avatar', NOW());
```

### Technical Components:

## üìä System Integration Summary

### Cross-Process Components:
- **Authentication System**: Used in all processes requiring login
- **Converse Identity Service**: Central to all masked interactions
- **Database Connection Pool**: Shared across all operations
- **Real-time Socket Service**: Powers live interactions
- **File Upload Service**: Handles media in multiple processes
- **Notification Service**: Sends alerts across all processes

### Security & Privacy:
- All processes maintain Converse Identity protection
- Database operations use prepared statements
- File uploads are validated and sanitized
- Real-time communications are encrypted
- Activity logging for audit trails

### Performance Considerations:
- Auto-save functionality prevents data loss
- Real-time masking optimized for low latency
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Caching implemented for frequently accessed data
- Load balancing for high-traffic operations

This comprehensive documentation provides the technical foundation for understanding and implementing all user operation processes in the Ikoota Institution application.
