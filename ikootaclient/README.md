# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh





To find your public IP:   curl ifconfig.me

Test Connection aws RDS mysql db
You can test the connection from your terminal using the MySQL CLI:  mysql -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <DB_USER> -p
Replace <RDS_ENDPOINT>, <DB_USER>, and enter your password when prompted. If this works, your AWS RDS setup is okay. If not:



ping ikoota-db.cvugpfnl4vcp.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com    (ping success)


users membership application/signup process.
membership with pending, granted, declined
it will start with 'applied' for moments when new user signs up with profile (email, phone and username) upto their submitting of a pre-requisite survey, till moment of is_member granted/approved or declined. it will be the admin that will vet the survey result/answer submitted by the applicant before decision for is_member granted or declined. 

At this stage of admin granting or declining membership from applicants, admin also have to create some properties or previledges for the user. (1) create a 6-digit alphanumeric letters and avatar that they will henceforth use in place of their profile for all open communication and messages/chats. (2) place user under a mentor by putting the mentor's id into their new user'd profile (a column for mentor 6-digit alphanumeric id#). (3) place the new user in a special demographic class (like classroom or like subject of study in a regular school system). This class is going to be synonymous to the 'audience' that the user can have internal communication/chats with apart from the general communication class which will feature in 'audience' for posting content/chat/messages. I propose that all these three properties will each have a column in the user's table and each of this column will have the three options that admin will need to choose or flip into. while for those applicants that are declined, their column will merely be filled will straight zeros (000000) as nil/null.

Now more about the converse Id system, mentorship system and users classes (audience for posting messages/chat) system.

converse Id system.
upon moment of membership granted, user profile (name/username, email and phone) will be encoded and the real names expunged from the system into an external record system. so a special encoding logic will be needed to convert the profile (email, phone, username and avatar) into a converse 6-digit alphanumeric letters and avatar that will thenceoforth be used for user identification or profile. It will only be the system that can decode/reveal the original id/profile when needed to relate with the real user. So, this is going to be a converse identity system from the moment membership is granted.
every user will have a permanent 6-digit alphanumeric id that will be used in place of their username from the moment membership is granted.

mentorship system.
Every user will have a mentor whose real id might not be known to them. but the mentors will know their mentee
So, user will be placed in a heirachical mentorship system from the moment membership is granted.

content approval
When a content/presentation is posted by a user, there should be content approval step as an admin vetting of the content before contents (messages/presentations) is allowed for public view. meaning every presentation/content posted with 'audience' as 'general'  will remain pending status and notification sent to admin for approval. whereas those posting to individual class or to idividual with will go striaght without approval of an admin. 
....... status` enum('pending','approved','rejected') DEFAULT 'pending',

users classes = audience for messages/chats
users will have a demographic sub-division to be known as classes. This classes will create opportunity for 
messages/chats to have specific audiences within the body of users and general/public as audience for all.

Explanation of Schema

    auth table:
    no need for auth table as all about authentication will be incorporated into columns of the user table.
    
    users table:
        Register, login, update profile, upload avatar to S3.

        blocked is a JSON array storing IDs of users that a particular user has blocked.
        Add a is_banned column to flag banned users.
        Add a role column. `role` enum('admin','user') DEFAULT 'user',
        Add a class column: moment membership approval is granted, a user will be placed in a specific class.
        ....with 000000(nil_class) for users pending membership and 6-alphanumeric letters used to id class that will be listed out.
        Add a mentor column. to show the id of mentor for every user/mentee.

Is there any difference between a content, a messages and a chat in chatting or teaching app? please explain. And if not much, I want the content table and messages table to be merged. and if a message/ content does not have 'title', 'description' or 'media type, the column can be made to be null/nil/000. It should be noted that some messages/content are gonna have more than one media types, so a way to accommodate the media_type to correspond with the media_url for a single message/content having a video and a music and an image urls must be provided.  
I want the column for name in the classes table to contain/store the pre-assigned or designated 6-digit alphanumeric Id-numbers that will double as target "audience" for posting content/messages. 
It should be also noted that comments do contain files or media types with their urls. so accommodation for files and media types/urls should be made in the comments table and if those are not included in a particular comment, the space/column can be nullable.
content table should not have is_public as the column for 'audience' which is target 'class_id' will take care of that as the 'general' class/class_id.
The role column in users table should include a 'super_admin' role for the senior admin that will manage a host of admins. 
consider all of the above, then make and provide adjustments

Use of libraries.
- Use `axios` for making HTTP requests.
- Use `@tanstack/react-query` for managing server state, caching, and synchronizing data with your backend.
- Use `zustand` for managing local state in your React application.




Using axios with react-query:
You can use to make HTTP request and react-query to manage the server state.

import { useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

export const useSendApplicationsurvey = () => {
  return useMutation((answers) => {
    return axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/submit_applicationsurvey', answers, { withCredentials: true });
  });
};



using Zustand for local State Management.
We can use Zustand to manage local state in your application.

import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  username: '',
  email: '',
  password: '',
  confirmPassword: '',
  phone: '',
  setUsername: (username) => set({ username }),
  setEmail: (email) => set({ email }),
  setPassword: (password) => set({ password }),
  setConfirmPassword: (confirmPassword) => set({ confirmPassword }),
  setPhone: (phone) => set({ phone }),
}));

export default useStore;


using Zustand in a compound:  
You can use the useStore hook to manage local state in your components.

import React from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import axios from 'axios';
import { useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import useStore from '../store/useStore';
import './signup.css';

const Signup = () => {
  const { username, email, password, confirmPassword, phone, setUsername, setEmail, setPassword, setConfirmPassword, setPhone } = useStore();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const { mutateAsync: registerUser } = useMutation((values) => {
    return axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register', values, { withCredentials: true });
  });

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    if (password !== confirmPassword) {
      alert('Passwords do not match!');
      return;
    }
    try {
      const res = await registerUser({ username, email, password, phone });
      if (res.status === 201) {
        navigate(`${res.data.redirectTo}`);
        console.log('res data at signup', res.data);
      } else {
        alert('Error: ' + res.data.error + ' - ' + 'Signup Failed');
      }
    } catch (err) {
      alert('Signup failed, please check your network and try again.');
    }
  };

Iko view-point.
Iko is the inner teaching/presentations and chatting system.
iko view port is partitioned into three layouts.
On the left-side is the listing of the chats/teachings/presentations..it is called chatlists.
On the right-side is the User-chats..that's listing of the chats/teaching that a user have become involved by commenting/signalled to follow.
While at the middle is the main display or render portion of the chatting system. It displays the latest chat/teaching by default, which also tops the listing of the leftside orderly arranged chatlist or these middle render portion display whichever selection that a user makes either from the left side chatlists or from the right side user-chats listings.

The teaching (also called presentation) can be input at the admin page by the admin or at an input terminal that is on the lower portion of the chatting system by the users. That's input of teaching or comments to teaching can be made by regular users at the bottom part of the towncrier viewport. And every of such teaching presentation made by non-admins regular users must be vetted by an Admin before it can go public class audience.
On the right side of the Iko viewport is the user_chats or list of active chats/comments that a user is involved in. It is not every presentation/chat/teaching that a user comments on or follow/watch/tail/track. so those ones that a user have involved on or have signalled to track that becomes the users user_chats are listed on this rightside of the Iko platform viewpoint.

Towncrier Open view port
This is the open home page that is the public teaching broadcast view-port of the website.
the towncrier viewport is divided into two parts; the RevTopic and the RevPresentation.
The RevTopic on the left side like a sidebar has a search bar over its top and displays the list of available presentation/teaching topics in timely order with the latest in topmost position being rendered/displayed by default or a selection amongst the list of topics by clicking render/displays that teaching/presentation on the larger right-hand side portion of the Towncrier screen called RevPresentation.
input of the teaching/presentaion into this open view port of Towncrier occur only from the admin at the Admin page. User cannot make presentation, nor any feedback here. its simply a broadcast screen.

todo list
prepare class_id and provide callup/fetch fxn in admin page

implement approval process of application survey with update on users column.
--fetch survey,update column, generate ID,



Note there are two kinds of teaching/presentation.
Teaching for the open public screen and teaching/presentation otherwise called chats going into the internal membership restricted system.


The content endpoints like in chatservice should be converted to teachings

input teachings to towncrier
--input/upload text, img, vid & emoji. write to s3
--arrange the side of RevTopic list 
--work on the search

input teachings to Iko. ....this is the chat. list of teaching/presentations is the chatlist. 
input comments to a chat/teaching/presentation.
implement search of the topics or summary or texts presnets.
Create Message fetching and saving 

implement username to converse_id in all communication.
--hierachical knowledge. mentor to know mentee, but mentee not to know or identify anyone. user only know mentee

work on profile display page.

properly setup and use socket.io and socket.js

admin controls.
how to check reports and actions like ban, delete, etc
dashboard analytics, is_flagged, use of isblocked and isbanned on users table

forgot-Password, password-Reset, 

confirm and make sure database in located at the RDS.

use of info messages to alert or as email to user/new user. 

Mentors sponsors new applicant by creating of application ticket/coupon and issuing to intending applicats that will signup with it. so use of application coupon (number) from a sponsorer like a mentor, which will lead to the mentor first vetting before new user will be allowed to even get access to the signup.

Abstraction of the real id from the storage system, least it be leaked/hacked. 


want to use AuthControls.jsx as the file or component where site admin will manage all that concerns authentication and authorization of this website.   AuthControls.jsx is going to be part of the Admin management system and it will be linked and displayed inside the Admin.jsx layout. first; in AuthControls.jsx i hope to have avenue for the admin editing (fetch and update) of the survey questions that is to be presented to new applicants users as applicationsurvey.jsx form, then the fetching of the filled and submitted application survey forms from the 'surveylog' database table when its ready for vetting the survey forms with 'applied' status, and do the actual 'granting approval' or 'declining' of the application, which is updating of the 'is_member' column of 'user' database table from 'applied' to the appropriate admin decision of 'granted' or 'declined'. And also, will likewise also have a similar logic to simplify the process with the option to select a choice of the appropriate corresponding feedback to the inform the new user applicants  of the result decision to their applicantion after the  approval or decline of the survey from the 'surveylogs', with an email reply made to the new users applicants using (approveverifyinfo.jsx, pendverifyinfo.jsx, suspendedverifyinfo.jsx/declined ) after vetting.
Secondly; want to also use and have part of  this AutoControls.jsx to assign roles (super_admin, admin and user)  and their  various permissions to users by having an avenue in it that admin will update the "role" status column in the 'user' database table . 
 want to also use TowncrierControls.jsx component as place where admin will handle the upload and management of  'teachings'; that will feature as teaching presentation in Towncrier.jsx and also feature as a part of Chat in iko.jsx of which will be stored in database table "teachings". There should be opportunity made for super_admin to edit/update all its content even after posting/saving.
want to use IkoControls.jsx component that will likewise be associated or linked or embedded into Admin.jsx layout as a place where admin will handle the  the upload and management of  'messages'; that will feature as in the components of Iko.jsx (ListChats.jsx, Chat.jsx, Chatlist.jsx, Comments.jsx ) of which will when not posted by an admin or super_admin, will initially be in 'pending' mode at the 'approval_status' column of database table "messages", awaiting its approval/update from 'pending' to 'approved' or 'rejected' by a user with admin or super_admin role. Also, in here admin should have place to manage  individual stages or status of 'messages' like the fetching of all pending, all approved, all rejected and all deleted teachings, and thereby be able to over-turning or editing or changing their status.  Inside this IkoControl.jsx, we should also want to have place to manage all that can be managed of the posted and featured Comments in Comments.jsx of Iko.jsx like deleting, and editing as stored in the database table of "comments".
